# Ecommerce Backend Learning Project

Welcome to my Ecommerce Backend learning project! This repository is a hands-on exploration of Node.js and Express.js as I build a backend for an E-commerce website. The goal is to understand and practice concepts such as RESTful APIs, middleware, modular code organization, and more.

## Features

- **Express.js Server**: Learn to create a powerful server using the Express.js framework.

- **RESTful APIs**: Explore the implementation of RESTful API endpoints for managing products, users, and orders.

- **Modular Code**: Dive into a modular code structure for better organization and scalability.

- **Middleware Usage**: Understand the role of middleware for tasks like authentication and error handling.
